#### Chat groups

- **PM Announcements ‘24** for daily camp announcements by staff only (no participant posting). Use https://chat.whatsapp.com/BDOMSleBDhu3a2uvrwGPjj to join. **Please join this group!

- **PM Dances ‘24** is an unmoderated group for conversations about and at camp. Use https://chat.whatsapp.com/HrixjosWA4fLMsCFL8Vnyg to join. All participants can post. Not everyone will want to be in this group if it gets too verbose, so **please reply privately** with thank you, I agree, etc messages and conversations that don’t involve the whole group.
- **PM Lodging ‘24** for questions about / issues with lodging. Use https://chat.whatsapp.com/KkP8Uq2BZH3J0k7oqeb9s2 to join.

#### Replying privately

In our WhatsApp groups, when what you have to say doesn’t pertain to the whole group, reply privately to keep spamming to a minimum. For example, asking a follow-up question or commenting in a way that’s personal to the two of you. This practice helps to keep the interest level up for everyone. Thanks!

To reply privately from an iPhone:

1. Press and hold your finger on a message until the menu pops up.
2. Tap **More…**
3. Tap **Reply Privately**.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1_1doLloFg) demonstrates the steps.

To reply privately from an Android phone:

### Covid care guidelines

Covid and other illnesses are on the rise again. To help keep everyone well, please:

- Be cautious in your interactions in crowded and indoor spaces for at least a week before traveling, 
- Consider increasing your supplement intake for that week (especially Vitamins C and D, and zinc) and gargling with Listerine after social engagements to help keep you healthy
- Take a Covid test at home before traveling, 
- Wear a mask while traveling to camp and anytime you ride a collectivo before or during camp, 
- Take a Covid test the first afternoon right before we gather (and maybe bring some extras for others or in case you start feeling ill),
- Don’t come to sessions if you are feeling ill or have symptoms. 

Thank you for caring for all of us!

### Fragrance-free camp

- We are a fragrance-free camp! Please purchase fragrance-free shampoos and other toiletry items prior to your arrival.
- Some of our dancers are sensitive to fragrances and/or have chemical sensitivities. This means perfume, scented essential oils, cologne, any strong smelling body lotions, suntan lotions, and shampoos, even washing your clothes in strong scented detergent. 
- Fragrance-free bug repellent:
  - DEET-free: Sawyer’s Picaridin, Coleman Skin Smart
  - With DEET: Sawyer Ultra 30, Sawyer Premium Controlled Release, Sawyer Family

### Preparing the dance space

- **WED** (Feb 7) now stands for **W**eed **E**xtraction **D**ay! Consider helping us pull weeds, pick stones, and groom the sand to create a beautiful place to dance.
- We are also looking for people to help assemble the collapsible shade structure, which allows us to dance in the shade in the daytime and under the stars at night. 

### Cell phones

#### Mexico plans

- Refer to your mobile phone’s plan details to see if using your phone in Mexico is included in your plan to avoid surprises! For example, Verizon plans that **don’t** include Mexico charge $10/day or $100/month to use your phone outside of the US.
- ⁠Pick up a physical Telcel SIM card from Oxxo and choose a prepay plan at the checkout. You’ll get a Mexico telephone number with voice, text, and data. 
- Other dancers report these companies offer good phone plan and/or SIM/eSIM card options:
  - Simple Mobil
  - Airolo - ⁠Get an eSIM through their app. This option is for data only, but it’s convenient, inexpensive, and it uses AT&T, Telcel, and Movistar, so you are almost assured good reception.

#### Wifi calling

- Wifi is prevalent now in the Cancun airport and the PM hotels & most restaurants.
- If your phone plan doesn’t include Mexico and you don’t have a Mexico SIM card, you likely can get by with keeping your phone in airplane mode and using Wifi calling while in Puerto Morelos.
- To do so (at least for US iPhones) you have to go into your settings and enable a special **Wifi Calling** setting **while in the US**.

### Acquiring pesos

- We’ve set up rides for you that can be paid US dollars, so you don’t absolutely have to have pesos with you upon arrival, but most people opt to get at least some pesos ahead of traveling. Most banks require that you have an account with them and it takes a couple of days to “order” them. Check the exchange rates and admin fees for the best rates. They can vary widely.
- Exchange booths and ATMs at airports typically have bad rates, and Mexico is no exception.
- The exchange booths in PM give fairly decent rates. They are on the town square next to La Sirena and just south of the square across from Pelicanos.
- The ATMs in Mexico can be quirky and/or they regularly run out of pesos.
- Jan and Kevin created [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sv9yaOiukrbtHwA6jmgeaU8XfWdDO2d3/view?usp=drive_link) explaining the importance of declining the ATM exchange rate at Mexican ATMs. It saved them about 7%!
- Be sure you are using a debit card in ATMs. Most banks treat ATM withdrawal using a credit card as a cash advance, which immediately starts accruing interest charges on your **entire** outstanding balance.
- Most basic credit cards charge a 3% foreign transaction fee. Check your cards. 
- Many restaurants accept USD, but typically for a horrible exchange rate. Watch closely.

**Note: Remember to tell your bank(s) the dates you will be traveling in Mexico using your credit card and/or debit card to lower the chances of a snafu while you’re in PM.**
