Unlike the typical DUP camps that happen at a contained retreat venue with on-site lodging and meals, the Puerto Morelos winter camp:

* Is integrated into the town
* Most meals take place in small groups in restaurants
* Lodging is spread out in various hotels
* La brisa del caribe (the often-constant ocean breeze) helps keep us cool in the heat, but adds a lot of frenetic, out-of-balance [vata energy](https://ayurvedichospital.com/en-blog/demystifying-doshas-vata-pitta-kapha){:target="_blank"}, making it:
  * Harder to contain energy in the dance circle
  * Harder to ground, go deep
* Tends toward community building rather than deep spiritual practice
* Is a DUP community vacation
* Views snorkeling, cenote and ruin trips, etc not as distractions, but rather as part of what this camp is about
