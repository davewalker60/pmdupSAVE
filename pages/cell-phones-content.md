#### Mexico plans

- Refer to your mobile phone’s plan details to see if using your phone in Mexico is included in your plan to avoid surprises! For example, Verizon plans that **don’t** include Mexico charge $10/day or $100/month to use your phone outside of the US.
- ⁠Pick up a physical Telcel SIM card from Oxxo and choose a prepay plan at the checkout. You’ll get a Mexico telephone number with voice, text, and data. 
- Other dancers report these companies offer good phone plan and/or SIM/eSIM card options:
  - Simple Mobil
  - Airolo - ⁠Get an eSIM through their app. This option is for data only, but it’s convenient, inexpensive, and it uses AT&T, Telcel, and Movistar, so you are almost assured good reception.

#### Wifi calling

- Wifi is prevalent now in the Cancun airport and the PM hotels & most restaurants.
- If your phone plan doesn’t include Mexico and you don’t have a Mexico SIM card, you likely can get by with keeping your phone in airplane mode and using Wifi calling while in Puerto Morelos.
- To do so (at least for US iPhones) you have to go into your settings and enable a special **Wifi Calling** setting **while in the US**.
