- **PM Dances ‘24** is an unmoderated group for conversations about and at camp. Use https://chat.whatsapp.com/HrixjosWA4fLMsCFL8Vnyg to join. All participants can post. Not everyone will want to be in this group if it gets too verbose, so **please reply privately** with thank you, I agree, etc messages and conversations that don’t involve the whole group.
- **PM Lodging ‘24** for questions about / issues with lodging. Use https://chat.whatsapp.com/KkP8Uq2BZH3J0k7oqeb9s2 to join.

#### Replying privately

In our WhatsApp groups, when what you have to say doesn’t pertain to the whole group, reply privately to keep spamming to a minimum. For example, asking a follow-up question or commenting in a way that’s personal to the two of you. This practice helps to keep the interest level up for everyone. Thanks!
