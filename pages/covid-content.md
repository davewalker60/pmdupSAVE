### Covid care guidelines

Covid and other illnesses are on the rise again. To help keep everyone well, please:

- Be cautious in your interactions in crowded and indoor spaces for at least a week before traveling, 
- Consider increasing your supplement intake for that week (especially Vitamins C and D, and zinc) and gargling with Listerine after social engagements to help keep you healthy
- Take a Covid test at home before traveling, 
- Wear a mask while traveling to camp and anytime you ride a collectivo before or during camp, 
- Take a Covid test the first afternoon right before we gather (and maybe bring some extras for others or in case you start feeling ill),
- Don’t come to sessions if you are feeling ill or have symptoms. 

Thank you for caring for all of us!

### Fragrance-free camp

- We are a fragrance-free camp! Please purchase fragrance-free shampoos and other toiletry items prior to your arrival.
- Some of our dancers are sensitive to fragrances and/or have chemical sensitivities. This means perfume, scented essential oils, cologne, any strong smelling body lotions, suntan lotions, and shampoos, even washing your clothes in strong scented detergent. 
- Fragrance-free bug repellent:
  - DEET-free: Sawyer’s Picaridin, Coleman Skin Smart
  - With DEET: Sawyer Ultra 30, Sawyer Premium Controlled Release, Sawyer Family

### Preparing the dance space

- **WED** (Feb 7) now stands for **W**eed **E**xtraction **D**ay! Consider helping us pull weeds, pick stones, and groom the sand to create a beautiful place to dance.
- We are also looking for people to help assemble the collapsible shade structure, which allows us to dance in the shade in the daytime and under the stars at night. 

### Acquiring pesos

- We’ve set up rides for you that can be paid US dollars, so you don’t absolutely have to have pesos with you upon arrival, but most people opt to get at least some pesos ahead of traveling. Most banks require that you have an account with them and it takes a couple of days to “order” them. Check the exchange rates and admin fees for the best rates. They can vary widely.
- Exchange booths and ATMs at airports typically have bad rates, and Mexico is no exception.
- The exchange booths in PM give fairly decent rates. They are on the town square next to La Sirena and just south of the square across from Pelicanos.
- The ATMs in Mexico can be quirky and/or they regularly run out of pesos.
- Jan and Kevin created [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sv9yaOiukrbtHwA6jmgeaU8XfWdDO2d3/view?usp=drive_link) explaining the importance of declining the ATM exchange rate at Mexican ATMs. It saved them about 7%!
- Be sure you are using a debit card in ATMs. Most banks treat ATM withdrawal using a credit card as a cash advance, which immediately starts accruing interest charges on your **entire** outstanding balance.
- Most basic credit cards charge a 3% foreign transaction fee. Check your cards. 
- Many restaurants accept USD, but typically for a horrible exchange rate. Watch closely.

**Note: Remember to tell your bank(s) the dates you will be traveling in Mexico using your credit card and/or debit card to lower the chances of a snafu while you’re in PM.**
